        **Please try following steps before report and tell me if the crash reproduces:**
        
        - Delete the config file to reset the config.
        
        - Tries Biome Modifier for Fabric mod alone (with its dependency).
        
        - Find the smallest reproducible set of this crash - for example, if this crash occurs when you only install biome_modifier, emeraldcraft, and terrablender, even if you add some new mods, the smallest reproducible set is the three mods mentions above if the same crash occurs.
